            </p>
            <p>In Washington, Congressman DesJarlais has built a reputation as a conservative leader. He is consistently rated as one of the most effective conservatives in Congress by groups like Heritage, the American Conservative Union and Americans for Prosperity. Additionally, Congressman DesJarlais has received an “A” rating from the National Rifle Association, and an “A” rating from Numbers USA, a leading organization seeking to stop illegal immigration.</p>
            <p>Congressman DesJarlais has a proven track record of fighting for policies that will enforce fiscal discipline in Washington, strengthen our nation’s economy, and end the flow of illegal immigration. While in Congress he has voted to cut income taxes and wasteful spending, balance the budget, repeal ObamaCare, and reform the food stamp program to help Tennesseans gain employment.</p>
            <p>Congressman DesJarlais’ legislation allowing members of the military to carry firearms at recruiting stations, which he introduced in response to the Chattanooga terrorist attack that claimed the lives of four U.S. Marines and a sailor, became law in 2016.</p>
